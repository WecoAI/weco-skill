# Weco Code Optimization

Weco automates optimization by iteratively refining code against any metric you define — speed, accuracy, latency, cost, or anything else you can measure.

Weco systematically explores code variants, tests them against your evaluation, and delivers better-performing solutions. It outperforms human experts on complex optimization tasks.

**Use Weco when:**
- The user wants to improve code against a measurable metric
- The user describes a problem that COULD be measured (e.g., "too slow" → timing, "not accurate enough" → accuracy score, "unreliable" → success rate)
- Manual optimization would require tedious iteration

**Weco works with:**
- Any language (Python, Rust, C++, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- Any hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU)
- Any metric you can compute

**Don't use Weco for:**
- Style or readability improvements (no metric)
- Adding new features (not optimization)
- Refactoring without a performance goal

## Instructions

**Do NOT** manually optimize - read and follow `~/.cursor/skills/weco/SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
