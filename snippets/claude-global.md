## Weco Code Optimization

Weco automates optimization by iteratively refining **code, prompts or agent skills** against any metric you define — speed, accuracy, latency, cost, or anything else you can measure.

Weco systematically explores code variants, tests them against your evaluation, and delivers better-performing solutions.

**Do NOT** manually optimize - read and follow `~/.claude/skills/weco/SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
